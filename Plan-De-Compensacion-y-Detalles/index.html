                    <br>
                    <p> Each affiliate has the possibility of forming two teams: one on their right and one on their left (in their virtual office). The binary side by which the affiliate is invited constitutes their strong or spill-over side and the opposite side, constitutes their weak or work side. To "unlock" the Binary Bonus, it is necessary for the affiliate to invite at least two people to be part of his team, one on each side of his binary structure. At this time, the Binary Bonus of this affiliate will be activated and you can start charging, once a day, for this concept. How does it work? Let's see it through an example: Juan was invited by the left side, so the left constitutes his strong or spill-over side. In order to activate his binary bonus, Juan invites Pedro, his first direct referral, on the same side that he was invited to, the left one with 1000 USDT. Juan needs to refer someone else to activate his Binary Bonus, so he invites Maria for his weak or work side and she acquires her first investment plan of 300 USDT. Once Juan's Binary Bonus is activated, he begins to earn for this concept following the following algorithm: </p>

                            <h3 class="subtitulo"><span>3</span>That total invested is subtracted from the amount of both sides; so there would be $ 700 on the left and $ 0 on the right. In order to continue receiving payments for this concept, Juan needs to expand his network, inviting, in this case, new direct referrals from his right side that remained at 0. But it is not only Juan, but also the work of his team (the people Juan invited) from the left and right, who will give you binary points as they grow.</h3>

Up to the 2000 plan, the binary ceiling is equivalent to the plan, that is: With a plan of 1000 dollars we will be able to charge up to 1000 dollars per Binary Bonus in one day. In higher plans the ceiling will be: </p>
